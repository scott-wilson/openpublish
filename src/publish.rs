/// The Publish interface.

/// This interface is used to define a publish process such as publishing an
/// asset, animation cache, etc.
///
/// The publish struct should not need any attributes or initialization methods,
/// since the context should contain all of the information needed to run the
/// publish, and optionally the results of each publish stage. Each publish
/// stage may transform the data within the context or session, then use the
/// transactions to make the transformation permanent. Transactions could
/// represent a filesystem update, publishing to a database, etc. Lastly,
/// transactions can be rolled back if one of the publish stages fail.
